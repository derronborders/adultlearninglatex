    \text{Using a mixed-methods approach, I aim to investigate the cognitive, moral, and social-identity development of adult learners, focusing on their readiness to engage with education centered on social justice and collective liberation through the lens of social epistemology and transformative learning. My research will explore how adult educators in a post-truth society can foster reflective judgment by equipping learners to engage thoughtfully with diverse perspectives beyond the confines of epistemic bubbles and echo chambers. Central to this inquiry is the use of narrative methods and the cultivation of affective qualities such as vulnerability, courage, empathy, grace, and trust.
